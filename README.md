# WORKDIR

This directory contains all data related to BigData, etc.

- GPU-Notebooks/ : This folder contains some useful instances or Dockerfiles about GPU enabled notebooks. Check out!
- data/ : This aims to isolate all data files in my workdir.
- logs/ : Contain logs about Tensorboard callbacks and other ones. This can be safely removed if we want to update this information.
- charts/ : Contain useful charts done manually or by Tensorboard


PD: The main idea is to link the information in this directory to elsewhere in the local system. This is very good to 
have a local storagement grouped up if one day I want to mount filesystems into another machine/s.
